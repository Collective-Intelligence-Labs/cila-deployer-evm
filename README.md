# Contract Deployer

## Introduction

`ContractDeployer` is a Solidity project designed to facilitate the deployment of smart contracts directly from their bytecode. This tool is particularly useful in scenarios where developers wish to deploy contracts programmatically or when the source code of the contract to be deployed is generated dynamically or provided by the user at runtime.

## Features

- Deploy smart contracts directly from bytecode.
- Simple and intuitive interface.
- Integration with Ethereum-based blockchains.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 12.x or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (version 6.x or higher)
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) (for local development and testing)
- [Ethereum wallet](https://ethereum.org/en/wallets/) with ETH for deploying contracts on the Ethereum network.
